### Ping

**Ping** is a computer network software utility used to test the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol network.   
Ping operates by sending **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)** echo request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply. The program reports errors, packet loss, and a statistical summary of the results.
